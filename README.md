# neutral-tumour-evolution

Code to simulate tumour evolution and produce synthetic sequencing data as described in - Williams, M. J., Werner, B., Barnes, C. P., Graham, T. A., & Sottoriva, A. (2016). Identification of neutral tumor evolution across cancer types. Nature Genetics. http://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3489

Simulation was written in the Julia technical computing language.
For download information see http://julialang.org/

The code is displayed in a Jupyter project notebook (http://jupyter.org/). This allows integration of code, equations, visualisation and explanatory text. For integration with the Julia language see https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl
